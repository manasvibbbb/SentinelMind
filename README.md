# 🏥 SentinelMind – Healthcare Workflow Intelligence

SentinelMind is a **Java Spring Boot–based healthcare operations intelligence system** that detects workflow anomalies using learned baselines and explainable rule-based reasoning.

The system helps hospital administrators identify operational risks such as **understaffing, patient surges, and delayed response times** before they impact patient care.

## 🚀 Features

- Workflow data ingestion via REST API
- Baseline learning using historical averages
- Explainable anomaly detection (no black-box ML)
- Persistent storage using SQLite
- Web-based operations dashboard
- Color-coded risk visualization (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)

## 🧠 How SentinelMind Works

1. **Ingestion**
    - Operational data (patients, staff, response time) is ingested via REST API.

2. **Baseline Learning**
    - The system learns “normal” behavior for each department using rolling averages.

3. **Anomaly Detection**
    - New data is compared against learned baselines using rule-based reasoning.

4. **Explainable Alerts**
    - When anomalies occur, human-readable alerts are generated and stored.

5. **Dashboard Visualization**
    - Alerts are displayed on a web dashboard for quick decision-making.
